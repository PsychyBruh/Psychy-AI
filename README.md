Psychy AI Website Development

# **Psychy AI: Full-Stack AI Chat Application Overview**

Psychy AI is a full-featured web application that provides an AI chat experience similar to ChatGPT. It combines a rich **frontend interface** for chatting and user settings with a powerful **backend** that runs AI models locally via **Ollama**. The project is built with Node.js and is designed for seamless integration – all components working together out of the box. Below, we detail the architecture and features of Psychy AI, organized by frontend and backend sections, with relevant examples and best practices from existing AI chat platforms.

## **Frontend Design and Features**

The Psychy AI frontend is inspired by modern chat interfaces (notably ChatGPT’s UI) and includes pages for the main chat, account management, and settings. The interface is built for clarity and usability, with a sidebar for conversation threads and intuitive controls for personalization.

### **Front Page (Chat Interface)**

The front page is a chat interface resembling ChatGPT’s layout, featuring:

* **Conversation Sidebar** – A collapsible side panel lists past chat sessions by title. Titles are *auto-generated by AI* based on the conversation content, similar to how ChatGPT generates conversation names from the first user message. This helps users quickly recognize chats by topic.  
* **Auto-Generated Titles** – Each new chat initially gets a placeholder name (e.g. "New Chat") which the system replaces with an AI-generated summary title once the conversation starts. (In ChatGPT, the system automatically creates a title from the conversation context, though users can later edit it.)  
* **Chat Management** – Right-clicking or clicking a menu on a conversation item brings options to **Delete**, **Rename**, or **Archive** the chat. This mirrors ChatGPT’s functionality where users can rename chats (ChatGPT provides an edit pencil icon to rename a conversation) and archive old ones. Archiving a chat in Psychy AI would hide it from the active list without permanently deleting it – a feature similar to ChatGPT’s archive, which allows hiding chats to reduce clutter. Users can unarchive when needed, preserving the full history.  
* **New Chat Creation** – A prominent *“Create Chat”* button starts a fresh conversation. This clears the chat window and begins a new thread in the sidebar. (Multiple open chats with separate histories are supported, as in other multi-threaded chat UIs like LibreChat.)  
* **Navbar and Profile Menu** – At the top, a navbar shows the **Psychy AI** logo and title on the left and the user’s profile picture and name on the right. Clicking the profile area opens a dropdown menu with account options:  
  * *Settings* – Navigates to the Settings page (described later).  
  * *Account Management* – Goes to the user profile/settings page.  
  * *Release Notes* – Shows the latest updates or changelog for Psychy AI.  
  * *Terms of Service* and *Privacy Policy* – Links to information pages on usage terms and data privacy.  
  * *Sign Out* – Logs the user out of the application.

The chat window itself supports rich content:

* **Markdown & Code Rendering** – The AI’s responses can include markdown formatting, code blocks, or LaTeX, which render properly in the UI (much like ChatGPT and open UIs such as Open Web UI handle markdown replies). Users can toggle whether to view the raw markdown or rendered result, according to their preference for copying code or reading formatted text.  
* **Streaming Responses** – By default, AI answers stream token-by-token to the chat (giving a typing effect). This provides faster feedback for long answers. An option exists to disable streaming if users prefer to wait for the full answer (Ollama’s API is streaming by default, but it can be turned off with a parameter). When streaming, a spinner or indicator shows that the AI is “thinking,” and the text appears gradually.  
* **Interactive Chat Controls** – For each message, users can copy text or provide feedback (like a thumbs up/down). There may also be a regenerate button to re-submit the last question for a new answer (common in many chat UIs).

	**Registration Page**

Email & Username Entry – Users input their email and a desired username.

Password Setup – Requires a strong password with validation (minimum length, special characters, etc.).

Confirm Password Field – Ensures users don’t accidentally mistype their password.

Profile Picture Upload (Optional) – Users can upload an avatar during registration.

Bio & Social Links (Optional) – Let users add a bio or link their socials from the start.

Captcha / Bot Protection – A CAPTCHA system like reCAPTCHA or hCaptcha to prevent spam sign-ups.

Terms of Service & Privacy Policy Agreement – Users must check a box confirming they agree before registering.

Submit Button – Once filled, users click Register to complete the process.

Email Verification Prompt – After registration, users are asked to verify their email via a confirmation link sent to their inbox before accessing full features.

Overall, the front page prioritizes an **intuitive chat experience**. By following patterns from ChatGPT and open-source chat clients (like having a persistent sidebar with chat history and easy conversation management2), Psychy AI’s interface enables users to smoothly interact with the AI and organize their dialogues.

### **Account Management Page**

Psychy AI includes a comprehensive account management page where users can view and update their profile details, security settings, and preferences. This page is accessible via the profile dropdown (selecting “Account Management”) and is organized into sections for different aspects of the account:

* **Profile Information**: Users can set or update personal info:  
  * **Email** – The email on file, with an indicator if it’s verified or not. A “Verify Email” button sends a verification link if the email is unverified (standard practice is to email a code or link for the user to confirm ownership). The verification status (Verified ✓ or Unverified) is displayed.  
  * **Username** – The unique username for the account (used for display and mentions).  
  * **Name** – Full name or display name of the user.  
  * **Profile Picture** – Users can upload an avatar image.  
  * **Bio** – A short text blurb about the user (optional).  
  * **Social Links** – Fields to link social profiles (X/Twitter handle, GitHub username, Instagram, etc.), allowing the user to showcase their presence elsewhere.  
* **Account Actions**: Buttons for critical actions:  
  * **Save Changes** – Saves any edits to the profile information or preferences.  
  * **Logout** – Logs out of the current session (equivalent to “Sign Out”).  
  * **Delete Account** – Permanently deletes the user’s account and data. (This would likely prompt a confirmation and perhaps a second step like re-entering password due to its irreversibility.)  
* **Security Settings**:  
  * **Password Management** – Options to change the current password. The user must provide the old password and a new password (with confirmation).  
  * **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** – Enables 2FA for account login. If activated, the user must enter a time-based OTP code (from an authenticator app or SMS) on login in addition to their password. Enabling 2FA typically involves scanning a QR code and saving backup codes. Psychy AI supports managing 2FA (viewing 2FA status, regenerating backup codes, etc.), aligned with common security practices where users can enable/disable 2FA and see their 2FA devices.  
  * **Register Passkey (Passwordless Login)** – Allows registering a FIDO2 Passkey for the account. Passkeys enable **passwordless authentication** using platform authenticators (like Windows Hello, Touch ID, or hardware keys). When a user clicks “Register Passkey,” the browser’s WebAuthn API is invoked to create a new credential tied to that device (prompting the user’s fingerprint, Face ID, or security key). Once a passkey is registered, the user can log in with a fingerprint or device PIN without typing a password. This feature adds both convenience and security, as recommended by modern identity systems.  
  * **Active Sessions** – A list of devices or browser sessions where the account is currently logged in. Each session entry might show device info, IP, and last active time. The user can **log out of other sessions** remotely from here. This “active session management” is a security best-practice: websites should let users view and revoke sessions to protect their account. Psychy AI’s interface provides a “Log out” or “End Session” button next to each active session listing. For example, if a user sees an unfamiliar session, they can terminate it and possibly change their password.  
  * **Account Activity** – A log of recent security-relevant events: logins (with date, time, location/IP), password changes, 2FA setup, etc. Keeping an account activity history further enhances security, as users can spot any unauthorized access.  
* **Notifications Preferences**: Options to control email or in-app notifications sent by Psychy AI. Users can opt in or out of notifications for events such as:  
  * New updates or newsletters about Psychy AI (product announcements).  
  * Alerts when a long-running chat task is completed (if the AI had asynchronous jobs).  
  * Changelog or release notes notifications.  
  * Security alerts (these might be mandatory, not optional). The interface likely uses checkboxes or toggles for each notification type.  
* **Accessibility Options**: Settings to make the app more accessible:  
  * **Font Size** – Users can increase or decrease the base font size of the interface for readability. Accessibility guidelines encourage offering text scaling for users with low vision (though browsers also allow page zoom, a dedicated option ensures the layout adapts properly).  
  * **Color Contrast** – A high-contrast theme toggle for users with visual impairments. This might be a quick switch to a theme with stronger text/background contrast meeting WCAG guidelines.  
  * **Message Preview Length** – Option to show longer or shorter preview text in chat list (for those who need larger text, maybe showing only first line vs first few lines of each chat in the sidebar).  
* **Data and Privacy**:  
  * **Download My Data** – A button to export all user data (chat histories, profile info, etc.) in a downloadable format (likely a JSON or ZIP file). This aligns with data portability rights and is similar to ChatGPT’s data export feature. For example, ChatGPT provides an “Export data” option in settings, which emails the user a ZIP of all conversations and account info. Psychy AI would gather all chats and relevant data and let the user download it directly (or via email link).  
  * **Delete Account** – (also accessible via the button in profile actions) ensures all user data is removed. Possibly requires re-confirmation or additional steps to prevent accidental deletion.  
* **Theme Customization**:  
  * **Pre-made Themes** – A theme selector to switch between at least 5 built-in themes (e.g. Light, Dark, Psychy Green, Solarized Light, and High Contrast). Changing the theme updates the UI color scheme accordingly. Users often appreciate light vs dark mode; many chat UIs allow quick theme switching either in settings or via a button.  
  * **Create Your Own Theme** – An advanced feature for power users to define custom color schemes. This could open a theme editor where the user picks primary, secondary, background, and text colors (potentially with live preview). Under the hood, Psychy AI might use CSS variables for theming, and this interface would let users set those variables. This is similar to allowing custom CSS or using tools like the Obsidian app’s custom theme builder. Users can name and save their custom themes. (A warning may be given that custom themes might affect readability if not chosen well.)

All changes on the account management page can be saved via the **“Save Changes”** button. Upon successful save, a confirmation (like a toast message) appears. In terms of structure, the account page may be divided into tabs or accordions (Profile, Security, Preferences, etc.) or a scrollable page with clear subheadings. The design follows common SaaS account settings layouts for familiarity. For instance, one case study highlights an internal account management app with sections for profile info, 2FA management, login history, active sessions, etc., all accessible in one place – Psychy AI’s account page covers these same elements.

### **Settings Page (Application & AI Settings)**

The Settings page allows users to configure how the Psychy AI application and the AI assistant behave. It is organized with a sidebar or menu listing categories (General, AI, Privacy, Advanced), each showing relevant settings when selected. This separation keeps the interface uncluttered by grouping related options together.

#### **General Settings**

General settings include basic preferences for the application:

* **Language** – The UI language for Psychy AI. Users can select their preferred language from a dropdown. (The app might initially only support English, but is structured to allow internationalization.)  
* **Theme** – A shortcut to change the UI theme (duplicating the theme selection in Account Management). For convenience, the theme toggle (Light/Dark) might also appear at the top level here.  
* **Default Page on Startup** – Option to choose what the user sees on login: e.g., open the last chat, start a new chat, or go to a welcome page.  
* **Time Zone / Time Display** – Users can set their time zone or preferred format (12h vs 24h) for timestamps (useful if chat messages show times).

#### **AI Settings**

These settings let the user personalize the AI assistant’s behavior and response formatting:

* **Default Assistant Personality** – Users can select a general personality or tone for the AI’s responses. Options might include *Default*, *Friendly*, *Formal*, *Creative*, *Technical*, etc. This effectively changes the system prompt or persona of the assistant. For example, a *Friendly* persona might make the AI use more emoticons or casual language, whereas *Formal* uses polite and structured tone. This feature is akin to setting custom instructions for ChatGPT to prefer a certain tone. Choosing a personality preset will prepend an appropriate instruction to each conversation (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant that responds in a friendly, upbeat manner.”).  
* **Response Length Preference** – A slider or setting to bias the AI toward shorter or longer answers by default. Users can set if they generally want brief answers or very detailed explanations. (Under the hood, this could adjust the target length or include instructions like “keep responses concise” when the user doesn’t specify length.)  
* **Markdown Formatting** – A toggle to enable or disable markdown in AI responses. If disabled, the AI will try to avoid formatting the output (e.g., useful if the user wants plain text responses for easier copying). With it enabled, the AI can produce rich markdown (for tables, lists, **code snippets**, etc., which the front end will render).  
* **Code Block Styling** – If the user often queries code, they may set preferences for how code is presented (e.g., line numbers on/off in code blocks, color theme for syntax highlighting).  
* **Streaming vs. Batch** – A setting to control whether the AI streams responses word by word or waits to deliver the full response. Some users might turn off streaming if they prefer to avoid seeing intermediate output or if they have a slow device (streaming can be turned off via the API by setting stream: false). By default, Psychy AI streams outputs for interactivity.  
* **Default System Prompt** – An editable text field for an advanced user to set a custom system prompt that applies to all chats by default. This is like a global instruction to the AI (for example, the user can input: “You are an AI that always responds in Shakespearean English.”). This feature parallels ChatGPT’s “Custom Instructions” where users set a persistent context for the AI. If set, every new conversation will start with this system instruction unless overridden.  
* **Automatic Title Generation** – A toggle to enable/disable the AI’s automatic chat title generation. If a user prefers to name chats manually or keep them all as dates, they can turn off auto titling. (Recall that by default, ChatGPT auto-generates conversation titles based on the first user message; with this setting off, the system could default to timestamps or generic titles until the user renames it.)  
* **Greeting and Closing Messages** – The user can customize whether the assistant should greet them when a new chat is started (“Hello, how can I assist you today?”) and/or provide a sign-off message when a chat ends (“It was nice helping you. Have a great day\!”). These defaults can make the AI feel more personal. The settings might allow the user to edit the exact text or choose from presets. If left blank or toggled off, the AI will simply start directly with user input and not add closings.

#### **Privacy Settings**

Privacy options give users control over data handling:

* **Chat Data Privacy** – An **Opt-out** toggle that, when enabled, ensures the content of the user’s chats is not used for any model training or analytics beyond providing the service to the user. (Since Psychy AI runs locally or on the user’s server with Ollama, data typically isn’t sent to external servers, but this setting could further enforce that no conversation logs are uploaded for any reason.) For instance, OpenAI introduced a setting to turn off chat history and model training, ensuring user conversations won’t be used to improve the model. In Psychy AI, enabling Privacy Opt-Out might disable any telemetry.  
* **Telemetry** – Options to disable/enable collection of usage data or error reports. If Psychy AI gathers anonymous usage stats (to improve the app), the user can opt out entirely for privacy.  
* **Data Retention** – Information or controls about how long chats are stored. A user could choose to auto-delete or archive chats after a certain period. (For example, ChatGPT retains conversations unless deleted, but here a user might schedule old chats to be archived or purged for privacy.)  
* **Consent for Improvements** – If Psychy AI ever offers an option to share anonymized prompts with developers to improve the AI (similar to how some apps ask for permission to collect data), this setting would control that consent. By default, it would likely be off, requiring opt-in.

These privacy controls ensure Psychy AI respects user data choices, aligning with approaches by major AI services to give users transparency and control over their data.

#### **Advanced Settings**

Advanced settings expose fine-grained AI model parameters and system configurations for expert users who want to tweak the AI’s behavior at a low level. Misconfiguration here can significantly alter the output, so these are usually accompanied by explanations or reset-to-default options. Advanced parameters include:

* **Model Parameters Tuning**: These settings directly influence the text generation algorithm of the AI:  
  * **Temperature** – A floating value (typically 0.0 to 1.0 or up to 2.0) controlling the *randomness* of the AI’s output. Higher temperature yields more random and creative responses, while a lower value makes replies more focused and deterministic. *For example:* at temperature 0.2 the model will be very conservative (often giving the same answer to the same prompt), whereas at 0.8 it may produce varied, imaginative phrasing.  
  * **Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)** – A probability threshold (0 to 1\) that limits the model to considering only the most probable tokens whose cumulative probability is below *p*. This balances coherence and creativity by ensuring the model doesn’t tail off into very unlikely word choices9. For instance, top-p \= 0.9 means the model considers tokens until 90% of the probability mass is covered, dropping the long-tail of rare options. Lowering top-p (e.g., 0.5) makes output more predictable, similar to lowering temperature.  
  * **Top-k** – An integer setting that restricts the model to picking from the top *k* highest-probability next-word options. If k=50, the AI will only consider the 50 most likely tokens at each step and ignore the rest. Top-k sampling thus cuts out extremely low probability words, reducing possible gibberish. Setting top-k to 1 effectively forces a greedy deterministic choice each time (most likely token always).  
  * **Presence Penalty** – A number (often between 0.0 and 2.0) that penalizes the model for using tokens that have already appeared in the conversation. This encourages the AI to introduce new topics or vocabulary rather than repeating itself. A higher presence penalty makes the model less likely to revisit the same point multiple times.  
  * **Frequency Penalty** – Similar to presence penalty but focuses on repeated terms frequency. It reduces the likelihood of the model repeating the *same token* (or word) frequently in its output. If the AI tends to echo the user’s phrasing or repeat certain words, increasing this penalty will diversify its word choice. Both presence and frequency penalties are used to avoid verbose or circular answers by the model.  
  * **Max Tokens** – The maximum number of tokens the AI will generate in a single response. Users can limit this to prevent overly long answers or set it high to allow very detailed outputs. (This is similar to OpenAI’s max\_tokens parameter which limits response length.) If, for example, max tokens is set to 500, the assistant will not generate more than roughly 500 tokens (\~375 words) in its reply.  
  * **Min Tokens** – A lower bound on the response length. This ensures the AI produces a minimum length answer (useful if users always want a substantive reply). For instance, setting min tokens to 50 prevents the AI from giving very brief answers.  
  * **Stop Sequences** – One or more user-defined text sequences that, if generated by the AI, will signal it to stop generating further text. This is advanced usage typically to control the end of generation. For example, one might add a stop sequence like "\\nUser:" to ensure the AI doesn’t start impersonating the user or continue past its turn in a dialogue. The interface might allow entering multiple stop sequences separated by commas.  
  * **Token Bias (Logit Bias)** – A setting where specific tokens (words or subwords) can be biased up or down in probability. This maps to the “logit\_bias” concept in OpenAI’s API. In Psychy AI’s UI, a user could input a token (or word) and give it a bias value, e.g. \-100 to ban it or \+100 to force it. For example, a user could ban the token “sorry” to prevent the AI from ever apologizing by adding it with a strong negative bias. This feature is powerful for steering the model away from unwanted words or ensuring certain words appear. (Under the hood, this requires knowledge of token IDs, which the UI might handle via a dictionary or prompt the user to enter exact words to bias.)  
  * **Repetition Penalty** – Another mechanism to avoid repetitive output, often used in local LLM frameworks. A repetition penalty \>1.0 will make it so that each time a token is used, its probability is reduced for future generation, discouraging exact repeat phrases. This can be an alternative or complement to the above frequency penalties. The UI can offer a slider for repetition penalty (with 1.0 meaning no penalty, 1.5 moderately high, etc.). In practice, this is commonly used in transformer models to improve generation quality by preventing loops.  
  * **Context Window Size** – (Display only, or adjustable if multiple models) This indicates how many tokens of context the model can consider. It’s determined by the model (e.g., Llama 2 has a 4096 token context length). If an “extended context” model is used (like Llama2 32k variant), this could be shown or selectable. The UI might not allow changing it arbitrarily, but it’s useful for the user to know. If the context window is large, the user can paste longer texts or have longer conversations without old context dropping. Psychy AI could list the current model’s context length here (and if multiple models are available, perhaps allow switching a model with a different context size).  
* **Persona and Prompt Customization**:  
  * **Persona Preset** – This overlaps with the “Assistant Personality” in AI settings but might allow even more fine-tuned persona definitions. For instance, advanced users might define a new persona profile (a custom system prompt) and save it here. Example: a user creates a persona “Math Tutor” with a detailed system prompt about showing step-by-step solutions, and can select that persona for relevant chats. This section might let users manage a list of saved personas (similar to how SillyTavern allows character profiles for roleplay with custom avatars and backstories).  
  * **Prompt Prefix & Suffix** – Users can set text that will always be added before or after their actual prompt when sending to the model. This is an expert feature for those who want consistent formatting. For example, a user might set a prefix: “Translate the following to French:\\n” so that they don’t have to type it every time when using Psychy AI for translations. A suffix might be something like: “\\nPlease answer in 3 sentences.” – ensuring every query gets that appended. Essentially, these are hidden prompt modifiers.  
  * **Response Style Guide** – An advanced option where users can provide a guideline the AI will always follow (unless overridden). For instance, a user could input: “Always answer with a short summary first, then details in bullet points.” The system would inject this guideline into the system message or prompt template for all queries. This differs from Persona in that it’s more about format than personality.  
* **System Settings**:  
  * **Hardware Info** – (Read-only display) Show the application’s detected hardware capabilities (e.g., “Running on CPU – 16GB RAM” or “GPU detected: NVIDIA RTX 3060 6GB”). This ties into the backend’s ability to auto-select models, but also informs the user in the UI for transparency.  
  * **Model Management** – If multiple models are installed, an advanced user might get controls to select the default AI model or switch models for a particular chat session. (Though not explicitly in the initial feature list, power users might benefit from a model dropdown if, say, they have both a general model and a code model installed. Some open-source UIs, like LibreChat, include a multi-model panel to easily switch between backends.)  
  * **Reset to Defaults** – A button to reset all advanced settings to the recommended defaults (in case the user experiments and wants to undo changes that made the AI’s output worse).

The Advanced section likely has warnings or requires confirmation to change certain things, since improper combinations (e.g., extreme penalty values) can degrade the AI’s performance. By exposing these options, Psychy AI caters to enthusiasts who want to experiment with the AI’s behavior much like they would in a research setting or in sophisticated UIs (for example, Oobabooga’s text-generation-webui provides many of these knobs in its interface for local models).

## **Backend Implementation and Architecture**

Psychy AI’s backend is built with Node.js, responsible for handling user requests, managing data (user accounts, chat history), and interfacing with the local AI model engine (Ollama). The backend uses proper routing to serve the frontend pages and a RESTful API for chat interactions. It ensures all the frontend features (as described above) have corresponding server-side support.

### **Project Structure and Routing**

The Node.js project is organized clearly to separate concerns:

* A /client directory (or similar) contains the frontend static files or React app.  
* A /server directory contains the Node backend code (routes, business logic).  
* Common configuration files (like package.json, build scripts) reside at the root.

Such a structure is common in full-stack apps where React is used for the frontend and Express for the backend. It promotes maintainability: frontend and backend code are modular but within one project, enabling integrated builds and runs.

**Routing** is handled likely by an Express.js server (or a similar Node framework):

* **Static Files**: The front-end (if built as a single-page application) is served by Node (for example, all paths not starting with /api could return the index.html, letting the React/Angular/Vue router handle actual view switching on the client side). If server-side rendering is used (e.g., Next.js), then Node would use that framework’s routing.  
* **API Endpoints**: The backend defines RESTful endpoints under an /api path. Key routes could include:  
  * POST /api/chat – for sending a user’s message and getting the AI response.  
  * GET /api/chats – list of chat history (for sidebar loading, if not embedded in the page).  
  * POST /api/chats – create a new chat session.  
  * PUT /api/chats/:id – rename or update a chat (e.g., archive/unarchive toggles).  
  * DELETE /api/chats/:id – delete a chat session.  
  * GET /api/account – fetch current user profile data.  
  * PUT /api/account – update profile info.  
  * POST /api/account/password – change password.  
  * POST /api/account/2fa/setup – generate 2FA secret or verify code.  
  * POST /api/account/2fa/disable – disable 2FA.  
  * GET /api/account/sessions – list active sessions.  
  * POST /api/account/sessions/logout – log out other sessions.  
  * ... etc., for other features (download data, etc., which might be implemented as on-demand archive generation).

The Express app would mount these routes and use middleware for authentication (ensuring the user is logged in for protected routes) and JSON parsing, etc.

**Session management**: Likely Psychy AI uses a session cookie or token authentication. Given it has active session tracking, a session table in a database is kept. The backend issues a cookie on login; for API calls, it verifies the session cookie and looks up the user. Alternatively, a JWT could be used, but since we want active session invalidation, a server-stored session (with an ID and user mapping) is easier to control (so the user can revoke a session by ID).

**Database**: The project would include a database (SQL or NoSQL) to store user accounts, hashed passwords, chat histories, settings, etc. For example, user info and preferences might be in a collection/table Users, chat messages in Messages linked to a Chats (which store conversation metadata like title, timestamps, and reference to user). Using a document database like MongoDB could store entire conversations as documents. The Node backend mediates all DB access.

The Node backend also handles input validation and security (checking that, say, a username doesn’t already exist on registration, sanitizing bio input to prevent script injection, etc.). It will apply the changes requested from the frontend (like saving a theme choice to the user’s preferences in the DB, or updating a chat’s title).

Importantly, **all frontend features described have corresponding backend logic**:

* Account deletion route triggers removal of user data in DB and any model cache.  
* Download data route compiles data from various tables and streams a file to the user (or prepares an email).

By structuring routes in a RESTful way and segregating config (General, Privacy, etc.), the Node code remains organized and aligned with the UI structure. This clarity in project structure ensures any developer or user can navigate and find relevant code easily, and it aligns with typical full-stack app designs.

### **AI Model Installation and Management (InstallAI.js)**

One distinctive backend feature is the **InstallAI.js** module. This is essentially a setup wizard that helps deploy a suitable AI model on the host machine. Its responsibilities are:

1. **Hardware Scan**: When run, it detects the system’s hardware capabilities. It likely checks:  
   * Available RAM.  
   * Presence of a GPU and its VRAM (using something like nvidia-smi for NVIDIA GPUs if available, or checking for ROCm for AMD).  
   * CPU information (number of cores, support for AVX instructions which are useful for faster CPU inference).  
   * Disk space availability.  
2. This information is used to assess what size of language model the system can handle. For instance, if only 8GB RAM is available and no GPU, a smaller model (like 3B or 7B parameters in a quantized form) is recommended, whereas a system with 32GB RAM or a 16GB VRAM GPU could handle a 13B+ model comfortably.  
3. **Use Case Query**: The script asks the user (or reads a config) for the intended use of the AI:  
   * *General Chat Assistant* – (capable in a wide range of Q\&A, conversation)  
   * *Coding Assistant* – (specialized in programming help)  
   * *Creative Writer* – (for story or content generation)  
   * etc. (Potentially other categories like “Math/Science tutor” or “Assistant for Documents” if different models are better at those.)  
4. **Model Recommendation**: Based on hardware and intended use, InstallAI suggests an appropriate model from the library of open LLMs. For example:  
   * If user wants a general chat model and hardware is moderate: it might suggest **Llama-2 7B Chat** (a 7B parameter model fine-tuned for chat by Meta) or perhaps a smaller distilled model if even 7B is too heavy.  
   * If hardware is high-end (e.g., a strong GPU), it could suggest a larger model like **Llama-2 13B or 70B** for better quality.  
   * If user chooses coding assistant and has decent RAM, it may recommend **Code Llama 7B or 13B**, which are specialized for programming tasks. Code Llama, released by Meta, is an open model specifically tuned for code generation and understanding, available in multiple sizes (7B, 13B, 34B). These models excel at helping with coding problems.  
   * Another coding model example is **StarCoder** by Hugging Face’s BigCode project – a 15B model trained on many programming languages. StarCoder has been noted to outperform other open code models on benchmarks and even rival OpenAI’s Codex on certain tasks. So if the user’s use case is coding and the hardware allows, Psychy AI might suggest StarCoder or its chat-tuned version StarChat.  
   * If user is more interested in natural conversation or creative writing, perhaps **Mistral 7B** (a newer small model with strong performance) or **GPT4All-J** could be suggested as lightweight options. There are many community models; the script could present a few choices ranked by compatibility.  
5. The InstallAI module might present a list like: “Based on your system (CPU with 8 cores, 16GB RAM, no GPU) and your chosen role (Coding Assistant), we recommend installing **Code Llama 7B** in 4-bit quantized mode, which should run comfortably on your hardware. Alternatively, you could try **StarCoder 15B**, but it may be slower. Please choose which model to install:” and then a selection.  
6. **Download and Install**: Once the user picks an option, InstallAI automates the model setup:  
   * It uses **Ollama** to fetch the model. Ollama is a tool that streamlines running LLMs locally by providing a unified interface and model registry. The script likely calls an Ollama command to download the model. For example, running ollama pull llama2 would download the Llama2 model weights, or ollama run model-name which automatically pulls the model if not present.  
   * Models might come from Ollama’s library or a specified path. Ollama supports pulling models by name (like "llama2" will fetch a default Llama 2 model). It can also import custom GGUF/GGML model files with a Modelfile if needed.  
   * For coding models, the script might fetch a model like codellama-7b, etc. Possibly using a command like ollama run codellama:7b which would pull the Code Llama model. Ollama’s design is such that if you run a model that isn’t downloaded yet, it will download it automatically.  
   * The model files are stored in a models directory (as per specification). InstallAI ensures the files go there (setting environment variable OLLAMA\_MODELS or moving files accordingly).  
   * After download, it might also set up an **Ollama configuration** (perhaps generating a default *Modelfile* with prompt templates if needed). For example, the coding assistant might use a system prompt that says “You are a coding assistant…” or the Modelfile as in the example that customizes Code Llama’s prompt format.  
7. **Configure Ollama to Serve the Model**: InstallAI likely also prepares the Ollama server. This could mean:  
   * Ensuring the Ollama service is installed (curl \-fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh as their install script).  
   * Setting the chosen model as the default to run. Perhaps writing a config that Psychy AI will use by default (so that when a chat request comes in, it knows which model to query).  
   * Possibly launching ollama serve if needed or informing the user how to launch it.

In essence, InstallAI.js acts as a guided setup to get the AI model up and running with minimal manual steps, tailored to the user’s environment. This is important because large models have specific hardware requirements and not all users will know which model fits their machine. By reading system specs and referencing known requirements (like needing \~16GB RAM for a 7B model, 32GB+ for 13B, GPU VRAM for larger ones, etc.), the script avoids the user downloading an incompatible model.

As a result, after running InstallAI, the user should have in the models/ directory a downloaded model (possibly in a quantized form to save memory) ready to go. For example, the script might download a 4-bit quantized variant of a model (these variants have much smaller size, e.g. a 13B model in 4-bit can fit in \~8GB memory). The example project for a coding assistant downloaded Code Llama 7B in Q4 quantization (a file like codellama-7b.Q4\_K\_M.gguf) to run on limited hardware, demonstrating the approach to make models more lightweight.

### **Chat API Flow (Conversation Handling)**

Once a model is installed and the server is running, the core runtime loop of Psychy AI is the chat API flow. This is how a user’s message goes to the model and comes back with a response:

1. **User Sends a Message**: On the frontend, when the user submits a prompt in the chat interface, the app sends an HTTP request to the backend – likely a POST /api/chat with the message and context. The payload might include:  
   * The chat session ID (so the backend knows which conversation this is part of, to retrieve past messages for context).  
   * The user’s message content.  
   * Possibly a “model” field if multiple models can be selected, or else the backend knows the default model to use.  
   * Maybe a flag if this is a regenerative request (to ignore the last AI response).

Example JSON payload:  
``` json
{  
  "chatId": "abc123",  
  "message": "How does a blockchain work?",  
  "model": "llama2"  
}
```
2. (If model is omitted, backend uses the default.)  
3. **Backend Receives and Prepares**: The Express route handler for /api/chat will:  
   * Authenticate the request (ensure the session or token is valid, user is allowed).  
   * Load the conversation history from the database if needed (the last N messages to provide context to the AI). The context length should not exceed the model’s token limit.

Construct a prompt to send to the model. Using a system-user-assistant format (like ChatGPT API or Ollama’s format). For instance, it may create a prompt string like:  
\[System: You are a helpful assistant...\]   
User: (user’s message)   
Assistant:

* depending on how Ollama expects input. If the model is a chat model, it might accept a JSON or specific format. (Ollama’s API can handle a conversation if using their chat completion endpoint, or one can prepend conversation text in a single prompt for simpler models.)  
  * Include any configured defaults (from Settings): e.g., if the user set a global prefix/suffix, or persona, incorporate those here (prepend prefix, append suffix to the user message, or adjust the system prompt).

**Backend Calls Ollama API**: Psychy AI’s backend then makes a request to the local Ollama server to generate a response. Ollama by default runs a REST API on http://localhost:11434 (port 11434). The typical endpoint is a POST to /api/generate with a JSON body containing the model and prompt. For example, as per the Ollama documentation, a call might look like:  
bash  
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate \\  
  \-d '{ "model": "llama2", "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?" }'  
which returns the generated completion. In the Node code, this would be an HTTP request using fetch or axios to the Ollama API. The backend will send: 
``` json
{  
  "model": "\<model\_name\>",  
  "prompt": "\<formatted prompt with conversation\>"  
}
```
4. to http://localhost:11434/api/generate. (If streaming, it may keep the connection open to receive chunks; if not, it waits for full response.)  
   It’s important that the backend uses **POST** for generation. (A common mistake is trying GET which will 404 – Ollama’s /api/generate only accepts POST with JSON.)  
   Ollama will then process this request using the chosen local model. If the model wasn’t already loaded into memory, it may load it (which can take a few seconds for large models) – however, if we used ollama run earlier, the model is likely already running and cached in RAM.  
5. **Receiving the AI Response**: The Ollama API will stream or return the AI’s output. If streaming, the Node backend will receive chunks of text. The backend should capture these and possibly forward them to the client in real-time (e.g., using Server-Sent Events or WebSockets for live token updates). If not streaming, it will get the full response as one payload once complete, which contains the assistant’s message. The response might also include metadata (like token usage or time taken).  
6. **Post-Processing**: The Node backend can post-process the model’s output if needed:  
   * Ensure it’s in the expected format (maybe remove any prompt artifacts, or trim incomplete sentences if a stop sequence was used).  
   * Apply any censorship or policy filters if necessary (e.g., if Privacy opted out of tracking, nothing special here, but if there were content rules, one might enforce them).  
   * Save the new assistant message to the database as part of the conversation history.  
7. **Send Back to Frontend**: The backend then sends the response back to the frontend client. If using HTTP polling (the simplest case), the response to the original POST /api/chat will contain the AI’s answer text (and perhaps some metadata like message ID, or conversation tokens count). If using a streaming mechanism, the data would be sent incrementally to the client.  
8. **Frontend Displays Reply**: Finally, the frontend receives the AI answer and renders it in the chat interface (appending to the conversation list). If streaming, the user sees the answer being typed out in real time.

Throughout this flow, **performance** is a consideration. Running local models can be slower than cloud (depending on hardware). The Node backend might have to deal with requests queueing – Ollama can queue requests or reject if busy. Psychy AI could implement a simple queue on the Node side for user messages if the user sends multiple quickly (or have a guard to not allow a new question until the current answer is done, similar to ChatGPT UX).

The backend uses Ollama’s robust API to avoid re-inventing low-level model management. Ollama abstracts away model loading and provides a uniform endpoint to hit. Indeed, one can list local models, etc., via its API as well, which Psychy AI might use for a “Model Management” section.

**Example:** A user asks, “Explain the significance of the number 42.” The frontend POSTs this to Node. Node wraps it perhaps as:

Prompt: "User: Explain the significance of the number 42.\\nAssistant:"

and sends to localhost:11434/api/generate with model “llama2”. The Ollama server returns streaming text: “The number 42 is famously the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything...” The Node backend streams this out to the user’s browser. The user sees the answer appear. Once done, Node saves the Q\&A to the DB and possibly triggers the title generator (the AI could be asked separately to summarize the conversation title, or the backend could do a simple heuristic).

This API-driven design ensures that the **frontend remains decoupled** from the model specifics. The frontend just calls our Node API; the Node backend in turn calls Ollama. This separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain. For instance, if in the future Psychy AI supports an OpenAI API instead of local, one would change the backend implementation of the chat route, but the frontend would remain the same.

### **Running the Entire Application (run-all.js)**

To simplify deployment and usage, Psychy AI provides a run-all.js (or possibly a script in package.json) that launches everything needed for the app to work with one command. This script likely does the following:

* **Start the Backend Server**: It runs the Node.js server (perhaps via node index.js or using a process manager like nodemon or PM2 in development). This initializes Express and all routes.  
* **Start the Frontend**: If the frontend is a development React app, run-all might concurrently launch npm start for the React dev server. However, in a production build, the static files would be served by Node directly. If using something like Next.js, the single Node process might handle both frontend and backend. In a simpler case, if backend is serving static, only one process is needed. But during development, running the React app (on say localhost:3000) and the Node server (on say localhost:3001) concurrently is common. The script can use a utility (like the concurrently npm package) to spawn both and keep output visible.  
* **Ensure Ollama is Running**: Since the AI model is served by the Ollama service, run-all.js should verify Ollama is up. This could happen in a couple ways:  
  * If Ollama was installed as a system service or is on PATH, the script can execute ollama serve in a child process. This will start the Ollama engine on port 11434\. The script might do this first, and perhaps wait a few seconds for “Ollama is running” message.  
  * If Ollama is already running (the user might have started it manually), the script could detect that by trying to ping the API. If it’s not running and not installed, the script may prompt to install Ollama or run InstallAI again.  
  * It might also load the default model. However, typically ollama serve alone doesn’t load a model until a request comes. To pre-load, the script could send a dummy request to the model so that the first user query is faster. Alternatively, one could use ollama run \<model\> which both downloads (if needed) and starts serving the model immediately. For example, ollama run llama2 would start the service and keep the model loaded for queries.  
* **Environment Configuration**: run-all might set environment variables needed. For example, ensure OLLAMA\_API\_BASE\_URL is correct (some clients expect it). However, by default, Ollama’s server is fixed at 11434 and accessible at /api/generate for local requests, so pointing Psychy AI backend to http://localhost:11434 is usually enough. The script could also set OLLAMA\_MAX\_CTX or other Ollama configs if needed.  
* **Logging and Feedback**: The script outputs logs from both Node and Ollama. It could merge them or label them for the developer’s convenience. If any process stops, it can shut down the others.

Essentially, run-all.js or an equivalent npm script (npm run start) is about convenience – the user/administrator shouldn’t have to manually start multiple processes. After installation and configuration, running this one command should make Psychy AI fully operational: backend up, model up, and UI accessible.

For example, after running run-all.js, the console might show:
``` bash
Starting Ollama... \[OK\] (listening on 11434\)  
Starting Psychy AI server... \[OK\] (listening on 3000\)  
Psychy AI is now running. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
```
Where the Node server on 3000 serves the web UI. The UI would communicate with Node (same origin) for API calls, and Node communicates with Ollama. All three components are now live.

### **Ensuring Cohesion and Completeness**

The backend is carefully built so that all features described in the frontend have corresponding implementations:

* Themes and preferences are stored and applied (perhaps stored in a settings field for the user, and the frontend gets them on login to apply theme, etc.).  
* Account actions trigger correct security flows (e.g., deleting an account not only removes DB entries but could also remove any model data caches or personal files if any stored).  
* Two-factor authentication flows involve sending verification codes if needed (which might require an email/SMS integration, though not deeply detailed here).  
* The archive chat function in frontend would call an API that flags the chat as archived. The backend might then exclude archived ones from the default query for chat list (unless specifically fetching archived chats).  
* Download data uses perhaps a background job if data volume is large, or directly zips data on the fly.

Security is also a key part: using proper hashing for passwords (e.g., bcrypt), checking all user inputs (to avoid XSS, etc., especially with things like custom prompts that eventually get rendered). Since Psychy AI can execute local AI, one must also consider prompt injection (users could attempt to make the AI execute system-level commands, but since Ollama is sandboxed to just generating text, we mainly ensure it can’t access filesystem or such via prompt alone).

With Node.js and a clear structure, adding future features (like perhaps share conversation or integration with plugins) would also be straightforward. The given design avoids “snippets or unfinished code” by planning out each component in full – so all pages (FrontPage, Account, Settings) are backed by working routes and logic, and the AI integration is end-to-end functional.

## **Conclusion**

Psychy AI is envisioned as a polished, user-friendly AI chat platform that one can self-host. Its frontend provides a ChatGPT-like experience with enhancements: multi-chat management (rename, archive), extensive user settings, and theming. The backend leverages Node.js for reliability and Ollama for local AI model inference, combining to deliver chat responses without relying on cloud APIs. Drawing on best practices from existing chat UIs and incorporating advanced configurability, Psychy AI aims to function as a comprehensive AI assistant solution. All components – from *account security* (2FA, passkeys) to *AI behavior tuning* (temperature, top-p, etc.) 9 – are implemented to work seamlessly together. This ensures that users can not only have intelligent conversations, but also have full control over their experience and data, fulfilling the promise of a full-stack AI website that is both powerful and personalized.

With a strong project structure and careful integration of each feature, Psychy AI can be run with confidence that everything from the UI to the AI is working in concert – truly an end-to-end AI chat system ready for use.
